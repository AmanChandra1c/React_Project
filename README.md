# React API

I recently built a React.js project that fetches and displays data from a REST API. The goal was to practice API calls, state management, and UI rendering efficiently. ðŸ’»âœ¨
ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Fetches real-time data using fetch or axios
âœ… Displays dynamic content with useState and useEffect
âœ… Handles loading and error states smoothly
âœ… Fully responsive UI with React & Tailwind CSS
